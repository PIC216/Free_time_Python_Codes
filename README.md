# Free_time_Python_Codes
A range of codes I created for fun.

While first learning Python I came across lots of recommended coding ideas for those starting out, some of these codes fall into that category while others are just codes that solve problems where I was interested in seeing if I could actually come up with a code that worked. (Hiding Cat, found in random codes, is my favourite.)

Enjoy!
